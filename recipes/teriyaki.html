  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These delicious shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or parties.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
    <li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 Â½-inch pieces</li>
    <li>skewers</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
  <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
